# Self Evaluation

1. What did you struggle with in this section?
- I struggled a little bit with the interchangeability between using strings vs. no strings with hash rockets and/or colons. I am feeling a little more confident after finishing the assignments but I do have to think a little harder when trying to explain or use either or.

2. How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
- This is actually a good question because I feel like I am taking my note-taking more seriously than when I started. It was one of the things I mentioned I wanted to improve on in the last live lesson. I found what is working for me is focusing on the vocabulary words and the more important details of what the lesson was about. I am also using more colors in my notes and have a legend for what the colors mean. My note taking is still a work in progress but it's much better.

3. What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
- I always tend to try and solve a problem by trial and error before *giving up* and trying Google. I find that I'm the type of learner that needs to try on my own, rather than just see or copy. I think my biggest worry after learning about productive struggle and unproductive struggle was knowing when to stop trying on my own and looking to Google for an answer. Honestly, I'm proud to say I've' been doing a great job at keeping myself from going into unproductive struggle!
